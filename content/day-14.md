# üî• Hot tips
As with any tool, the true power of AI lies in **how** you use it. The more you interact with AI, the more valuable it becomes. Keep these tips in mind as you continue exploring:

- **Start with a question or problem**: AI works best when you have a specific thought to explore, a decision to make, or a challenge to unpack. If you‚Äôre unsure where to start, try phrasing your thoughts as a question.
- **Use AI as a thinking partner**: Whether you‚Äôre weighing pros and cons, comparing options, or brainstorming ideas ‚Äî AI can help you consider different angles and provide data-backed insights ‚Äî let AI challenge you.
- **Be clear about what you need**: The more specific your request, the better the response. Let AI know if you need a quick summary, a detailed explanation, or a step-by-step guide to get the most relevant answer.
- **Keep the conversation going**: No need to start from scratch! Ask follow-up questions, refine your request, or ask AI to adjust its response without repeating all the background details.
- **Revisit old chats for continuity**: Picking up a previous conversation allows AI to retain context, saving time and making responses more relevant. It‚Äôs like having an ongoing dialogue rather than starting over each time.
- **Never settle ‚Äî ask for more!**: Want a different tone? A simpler explanation? A deeper dive? Or just need AI to give the answer another go? Just ask. AI can tailor responses to match your needs, whether you‚Äôre after a casual summary or an expert-level breakdown.
- **Turn messy thoughts into structured ideas!** Don‚Äôt wait before getting AI involved. Whether you have a jumble of notes, half-formed ideas, or scattered thoughts ‚Äî just paste them in and rely on AI to organize, refine, and bring clarity to the chaos.
