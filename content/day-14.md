## 🔥 Hot tips
As with any tool, the effectiveness comes in **how** you use it — so the real value of AI will present itself with continued use. Remember some of these tips as you continue your journey: 

- **Start with questions**: It’s best to engage AI when you have the formations of a thought, something you want to know, or a topic that needs to be unpacked
- **Use AI to help you decide**: AI can assist in weighing pros and cons, comparing options, and providing data-backed insights to make decisions. Whether it’s picking a restaurant, making a work-related decision, or choosing the best travel route — let AI challenge you.
- **Be clear about the outcome you expect**: Clearly stating what you want from the AI response helps it provide more targeted answers. For example, mention if you need a quick summary, a detailed explanation, or a list of actionable steps.
- **Ask follow-up questions without needing to reframe the original question**: Keep the conversation going by asking follow-up questions that naturally extend your previous one. This way, you don’t have to repeat the background information, and AI can build on what was already discussed.
- **Return to old chats to build on existing context**: Revisiting old conversations can save time. You can pick up where you left off, allowing AI to use existing context to provide even more insightful responses and a sense of continuity.
- **Ask for more!**: Ask AI to elaborate, change detail of explanation, tone or level of expertise. Whether you want a simpler explanation, a more formal tone, or an advanced deep dive, you can ask AI to adapt.
- **Content is key!** Paste as much content as you like, in whatever format or state of completeness and get AI to make sense of it. So if you have a jumble of notes, ideas, or incomplete thoughts, AI can help you structure, refine, and make sense of them, transforming chaos into clarity.
