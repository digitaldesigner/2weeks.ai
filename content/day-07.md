# Adding Content
To wrap up our first week, we’re diving into using AI with long-form content — rounding off our exploration of different input methods like text, voice, and images.

# Uploading Files (Or Copy-Pasting)

```
The free version of ChatGPT does not currently support file uploads like PDFs or spreadsheets. However, since it allows messages up to 3,000 words, you can simply copy and paste large chunks of text instead!
```

## Adding Content
AI isn’t just great at short chats — it can also analyze, summarize, and interact with longer documents like emails, news articles, research papers, legal and financial documents and more.

As a simple example, if you paste a long email, you can ask:

> Summarize this email and highlight any key points I should respond to:<br />{{paste long email}}

## Using Documents as Context
Just like we’ve used context in text conversations, we can do the same with pasted documents. Once AI has read a piece of content, you can continue the discussion.

After summarizing an email, you could follow up with:

> Here’s my reply. Did I address all the key points?<br />{{paste reply}}

You can then tweak your response with AI’s help:

- 📝 “Improve my response and make it more concise.”
- 💼 “Make my reply more professional but still friendly.”
- 😎 “Rewrite this in a more casual and engaging tone.”

The best part is that once the text is pasted, AI becomes an expert on it — it’s like talking **with** your documents.

## Everyday Use
Summarizing emails is just the start — here are more powerful and practical ways AI can process large amounts of text:

### 📔 Exam Prep
Copy text from a long document, research paper or book and let AI quiz you on it:

> Create a 5-question multiple-choice quiz based on this text and grade my answers.

Or ask for a breakdown, like “Summarize the part about cell division in simple terms for beginners.”

### 🥱 Terms & Conditions
We all skim through terms of service, but AI can do the hard work in helping you understand their meaning:

> The valet company scratched my car — what does this document say about their liability?

Or you could upload the terms of service for a new bank account and ask:

> Give me precise instructions on how to earn the maximum interest based on this document.

You could even ask for insight into the document itself, like checking for hidden clauses:

> Is there anything unusual in this contract that I should be aware of?

### 🤓 Common Sense Contracts
Like terms and conditions, anything that’s written in unecessarily complicated legal terms can be easily translated into plain language by AI. Things like employment contracts, mortgages, and rental agreements become documents you can query:

> What are the consequences of breaking this lease after six months?

On the topic of real estate, try pasting in the contents of a property listing and asking AI:

> Remove all the real-estate buzzwords and give me a simple, common-sense description of this property:

### 📰 Interpret The News
The media is full of opinions, bias, and emotionally charged language, making it hard to separate fact from interpretation. AI can help by breaking down complex topics, identifying bias, and presenting a clearer, more balanced perspective. **Try:**

> Summarize this article without bias:

Or even using what we learned about leveraging AI to consider different opinions:

> Does this article provide a complete view of the issue? What perspectives might be missing:

# Today’s Task
If you haven’t already, pick one long-form piece of content that you’ve written — like an email or document — then ask AI to rewrite it in a completely different style:

- 🇬🇷 “Rewrite this as a Greek myth.”
- 🍛 “Rewrite this in the style of a chaotic Yelp review.”
- 🧑‍🔬 “Make this sound like a scientific research paper.”

```
If you have a paid version of ChatGPT, simply upload your doc instead of copy-pasting! This is powerful for questioning spreadsheets or complicated formats, like presentations or PDFs.
