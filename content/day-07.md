# Lord of the files 🗂
By the end of our first week, we’ll dive into file uploads, rounding off our exploration of input methods like text, voice, photos, and attachments.

```
Since saving and finding files can be tricky on phones, this might be a good opportunity to try ChatGPT on a computer. Just head to chatgpt.com, where you’ll find your chats in a familiar interface.
```

## Understanding docs
AI doesn’t just understand text or interpret photos — it’s also skilled at reading and analyzing long documents like PDFs, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.

For example, you can upload something like [this 49-page PDF](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/citizenship-subsite/files/our-common-bond-testable.pdf) from the Australian Government’s citizenship test and ask:

> Summarise the contents of this document

### A bit of an expert 🐷
The strength of this feature is that once the document is uploaded, AI becomes an expert in that content. You can ask follow-up questions, like:

> Ask me 3 questions that might be on the citizenship test

You might even want to ask questions about things that are **not** in the file, like:

> Are there any topics you’d expect to see in this document that aren’t covered?

***

## Real-World Use
How you use this feature will depend on the documents you work with regularly. Here are a few examples from my own experience:

```
If you can’t download or upload a large file, you can always copy and paste the text. Just say, “Here’s a document I received, help me understand it better” and paste it in
```

### Please read the terms and... 🥱
You know those long, boring terms and conditions for things like renting a car or opening a bank account? GPT excels at simplifying these. You could ask:

> The valet company scratched my car—what does this document say about their liability?

I recently uploaded the entire terms of service from a bank and said:

> What are the exact steps to earn the maximum interest from the Saver account?

It revealed hidden details I would have missed, which the bank was likely hoping I wouldn’t find! 💰💰💰

### Digging through the archives 🪣
Just like yesterday’s bird-counting exercise, AI can easily sift through large amounts of data. For instance, you could upload 12 months of credit card statements and ask:

> Is there seasonality behind my Waitrose purchases?

Remember, AI works best as a **conversation**. Start with one question, and follow up as you explore further. If you’re dealing with spreadsheets or financial data, you can even ask for a graph based on your findings.

## Getting quizzy 😵‍💫
Feel free to upload your own documents and explore the possibilities. For a fun challenge, you could download the [Lawmakers guide to UK law](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/migrated/justice_-_law_for_lawmakers.pdf) (68 page PDF), upload it to ChatGPT, and ask:

> Create a 5-question multiple-choice quiz based on this document and grade my answers

I scored 3/5 — looks like I need to brush up on my parliamentary sovereignty knowledge! How did you do?
