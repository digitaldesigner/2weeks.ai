# Learning with AI
<div class="tag"><span class="level-3">Advanced</span></div>

AI isn’t just a handy editor — it can also be your personal tutor, adapting to your learning style, simplifying complex ideas, and even quizzing you!

Unlike traditional learning — where you’re limited to one book or a pre-written course — AI lets you explore topics in a way that suits you. Whether you learn best through metaphors, examples, quizzes, or deep research, AI can tailor explanations to match your style. There are also no dumb questions, so if you get stuck on a topic... AI has infinite patience!

## Pick a Topic
The first step in learning is choosing a topic that interests you. For this lesson, we’ll use **black holes** as an example, but feel free to pick your own.

When starting a new conversation, it’s helpful to set some context so AI understands where to begin. For example:

> I’m interested in learning about black holes. I know nothing about them — where should I start?

Or if you have some prior knowledge:

> I understand the basics of black holes, but I’m struggling with the physics. Can you help me go deeper?

***

# Customize Your Learning Experience
AI often starts with broad answers to give an overview, but you can refine the conversation to match your learning preferences. Here’s how:

## 🎯 Break Topics into Smaller Parts 
If a subject feels overwhelming, ask AI to break it down into bite-sized sections. For example:

> Can you outline the key concepts I need to understand before diving into the details of black holes?

## 🎚️ Adjust the Level of Detail
Want more depth? Be specific about the level of complexity you’d like to see. You could ask:

> In this conversation I’d like more detailed answers.

Or even:

> I have a Physics degree, so feel free to use advanced terminology.

## 📝 Set an Output Style
Everyone learns differently. If you prefer a particular approach, ask for it:

- **Stories & Metaphors**: “Explain black hole escape velocity using household objects, as if I were 8 years old.”
- **Step-by-Step Guides:** “Walk me through this concept like a tutorial.”
- **Research-Based:** “Provide sources and evidence to support your explanation.”

And remember, if something doesn’t make sense, just ask AI to rephrase or simplify:

> Can you explain that in a different way?

# Get Resourceful
Learning doesn’t have to stop with AI — there are plenty of ways to deepen your understanding beyond your conversation. AI can help you find books, articles, activities, and even events to take your learning further.

## 📖 Book & Article Recommendations
If a topic really grabs your interest, ask AI for suggestions on books, podcasts, or research papers:

> Can you recommend books, podcasts, or articles on this topic?

Or if you’ve already found a book that sounds interesting, AI can summarize it for you before you commit to reading:

> Give me a summary of Principles of Astrophysics by Charles Keeton.

Of course, as you read you might come across concepts you don’t fully grasp — just ask AI to explain them in a way that makes sense to you!

## 🎭 Activities & Experiences
Reading is great, but hands-on learning can be another powerful way to solidify your understanding. AI can suggest practical activities, experiments, or real-world experiences to reinforce what you’re learning:

> Are there any practical activities or experiments I can try that will help me understand this concept a little better?

Or even:

> Can you suggest any lectures, talks, exhibitions or events that I should attend?

By combining AI with real-world learning, you can turn any subject into an engaging, interactive experience! 🚀

# Test Yourself
Once you feel like you’ve got a solid grasp of your topic, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test! AI can quiz you, summarize key points, or even challenge your understanding in surprising ways.

## 🎯 Take a Quiz
See how much you’ve learned by asking AI to quiz you:

> Give me a multiple-choice quiz on what we’ve covered so far and grade my answers.

If you miss a question, don’t worry — AI can explain the correct answer to help reinforce your learning.

## 📝 Summarize & Get Homework
If you’re returning to a topic, or a quiz isn’t your speed — you can ask AI for a summary and a way to keep learning:

> Summarize everything we’ve discussed on this topic, and give me some homework to go deeper.

Or, maybe even blow your mind a little...

## 🤯 Challenge Your Understanding
Finally, if you think you’ve mastered the topic — get AI to shake things up with a mind-blowing fact:

> I think I understand this. Give me a fact that will blow my mind and make me question my understanding.

By testing yourself, refining your knowledge, and staying curious, you’ll turn AI into an even more powerful learning tool. The beauty of AI is that every question leads to another!

## 💡 App Tip
When starting a new topic, start a new chat `1` so AI can focus on that subject without distractions:

  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/return-to-chat.png" />

When you want to continue learning, go back to the same chat `2` — this way, AI remembers your progress and builds on what you’ve already discussed:
