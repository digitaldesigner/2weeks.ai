# Learning new topics
One of the best uses for ChatGPT is exploring topics you’re curious about but don’t fully understand yet. In my home, it's quantum physics; in yours, it might be energy efficiency, deep-sea exploration, or nano-technology. Whatever your interest, AI can be your guide!

## 1️⃣ Pick a topic
The journey starts with choosing a topic that truly intrigues you. Today, let’s go with **space exploration** 🚀 as an example. When using GPT to learn, a single chat often turns into a detailed conversation with follow-up questions, so start with a fresh conversation. For instance:

> I’m interested in learning about space exploration. Where do I start?

## 2️⃣ Break it down
AI often begins broadly, offering a general summary. To make it easier to digest, break the topic into smaller parts. This can be done by guiding GPT with prompts like:

> In this conversation, I’d like more detailed answers, please. 

## 3️⃣ Stay curious
Your learning depth depends on the questions you ask. Try different types of questions to get the most out of your exploration:

- ☝️ **Ask for clarity**: “What does escape velocity mean?”
- 👨🏼‍🏫 **Request simpler explanations**: “Could you break that down in simpler terms?”
- 🤓 **Don’t shy away from “dumb” questions**: “Is there any credible evidence behind the moon landing conspiracy?”

## 4️⃣ Seek out resources
ChatGPT isn’t limited to just text-based answers; you can ask for book suggestions, articles, or websites to deepen your learning. Try:

> Can you suggest any good books or articles on this topic?

Then when you find a resource that interests you the most, you can ask for a summary of that, too:

> Give me a summary of 'Principles of Astrophysics: Using Gravity and Stellar Physics to Explore the Cosmos' by Charles Keeton

Questions may keep popping up as you read, sparking even more learning.

## 5️⃣ Wrap it up
Once you’re ready to pause for the day, wrap up by asking for a fun quiz or a quick summary:

> Quiz me on what we’ve covered so far.

## Continuous learning, later
This approach works for any topic you’ve explored with ChatGPT. Revisit past chats to pick up right where you left off. Tap the icon at the top left of the app, and choose a past chat:

When you find your chat, try:

> Let’s continue where we left off. Where were we?

🍏 Happy learning!
