# Fact-checking
**Fake news!** Today’s lesson focuses on using AI for effective research. In a world where news is distilled into soundbites and major media often lean toward particular narratives — finding a balanced perspective can be challenging. With ChatGPT, we can harness AI to prioritize accuracy, credibility, and a neutral outlook.

Today we’ll learn how to use AI to evaluate sources through examples and evidence, fact-check topics by cross-referencing sources, and use citations effectively. Importantly, we’ll leverage AI’s neutrality for unbiased insights.

# 🗺 Guidelines
When researching, distinguishing reliable information from misleading content is essential. AI can expedite and improve research quality, ensuring it meets high standards. Here’s how to avoid misinformation:

### Effective prompting ✏️
The clarity and depth of your questions affect research quality. Frame questions precisely and specify the type of evidence you need (e.g., historical data, scientific findings, statistics).

### Check your sources 🍝
Seek information from credible sources (e.g., academic journals, government websites, respected news agencies). Use AI to compare details from multiple reputable sources for consistency.

In fast-evolving fields, like technology or science, prioritize recent sources (preferably within the last five years).

## Let’s get controversial!
Feel free to grab the nearest hot-button topic from your favourite news outlet. Or perhaps try:

> I heard that crime rates in the UK are rising due to “soft” sentencing. Help me research this topic

**Or**

> Compare the economic impact of renewable energy investments over the past decade to fossil fuel subsidies. Which has shown more long-term benefits?

ChatGPT generally uses reliable sources: Government websites (e.g., NHS, CDC, Gov.uk), educational institutions, mainstream news organizations (e.g., BBC, Reuters, The Guardian, or other well-established news outlets), scientific and academic journals and specialized resources in topics like finance or history, such as Investopedia.

## Leaning into discomfort 🌶
While the first answer might confirm your views, AI’s true value lies in presenting neutral perspectives. Follow up with questions like:

> Is there any evidence to the contrary?

To deepen your understanding, explore cited sources, bring relevant quotes back to the chat, and scrutinize facts by cross-referencing.

Of course, you might just end down an AI 🕳️🐇 which might not be a terrible thing when trying to understand a hot topic.

> Present data showing how different criminal justice policies impact recidivism rates

## Wrapping it up 👽
The key to unlocking AI’s potential is curiosity, critical thinking, and a healthy dose of skepticism. And to end on a lighter note, try:

> Help me convince an alien that Earth is worth visiting.

**Happy researching!**
