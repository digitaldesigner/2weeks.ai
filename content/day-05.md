# Talking With AI
We’ve done plenty of writing — now it’s time to start **talking**! Interacting with an AI through speech is a unique and sometimes uncanny experience, so get ready to question reality a little.

## Getting Started 🚀 
Talking is simple, just follow these steps — and maybe give this article a read before jumping straight in.

1. **Open** a new chat.
2. **Tap the voice icon**, instead of typing in the message box.

This will start a voice conversation instead of a written one, and you’ll be greeted by your AI assistant. If you’re unsure what to say, start with a simple **“hello.”**

## When To Use Voice
Voice chat gives you the same AI-powered responses as text, but in a faster, more natural way. Think of it like knowing when to call someone instead of sending a message — it’s great for:

- 💭 Casual conversations.
- 🧠 Quick brainstorming sessions.
- 🚗 Hands-free chats when you’re busy.

For today’s lesson, try something simple, like:

> I’ve been learning how to use AI for five days straight. How do you think I’m doing?

This will help you get comfortable with the experience of talking to AI instead of typing.

## Some Voice Basics 
You’ll notice how surprisingly human-like AI’s responses are — and you might even find yourself speaking more politely than usual! Feel free to talk naturally, but keep these tips in mind:

- ✋🏼 **Interrupt** — Unlike real-life conversations, AI won’t be offended if you cut it off. If it starts rambling or glosses over something interesting, just start talking — you don’t have to wait for it to finish.
- 🗣 **Ask for a different tone** — You can ask the AI to “take a more serious tone,” “speak slower”, “whisper” or be “sarcastic.” It’s a flexible conversational partner.
- 🔇 **Silence is okay** — No need to fill every pause. If there’s a break in conversation, AI will simply wait until you’re ready to speak again.
- 👩🏼 **Change your settings** — You can even change the voice if you’d like a different feel to your conversation. Just tap the settings icon at the top right:

# Today’s Task
There’s no structured task today — just get comfortable talking to ChatGPT. Try using it at some point during your day, perhaps for a quick, lighthearted question, like:

> If I had to describe my morning as a movie trailer, what would it sound like?

Alternatively, try placing an open voice chat on the table while chatting with a friend — you’ll see how AI adapts to multiple voices, follows the conversation, and chimes in at the right moments.

## Other Uses
Besides casual chats, Voice AI has some practical uses too:

- 🗂 Dictating notes & to-do lists – Quickly turn thoughts into text.
- 📧 Drafting emails & letters – Speak naturally, then edit the text later.
- 💡 Capturing ideas – Get your thoughts down before they disappear!

Voice-to-text has advanced significantly, and AI truly shines in this area. No need to change how you speak — just talk naturally, and let your AI transcription buddy handle the rest!

**Happy chatting!**
