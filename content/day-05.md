# Talking to AI
We’ve done plenty of writing, now it’s time to start **talking**! 🎙️ Interacting with an AI through speech is a unique and sometimes uncanny experience, so get ready to question reality a little. 🤖 But first, let’s say hello. 👋

## 🚀 Getting started

Before diving in, take a moment to read through these steps. First, open a new chat and select the voice icon instead of typing into the message box:

Once you see the blue orb, tap the settings icon at the top right:

![Choose a voice](./assets/images/voice-type.png)

From here you can choose from a range of overly-enthusiastic voices. I use **Juniper**, but **Vale** sounds delightful. Once you choose a voice, tap `Done` and start talking.

## When to use audio
Audio AI gives you the same kind of responses as text chat, but in a faster, more conversational format. It’s perfect for lighthearted discussions or quick questions that don’t require deep reflection.

```
Use audio AI on the occasion that you'd phone a (really smart) friend to ask a question
```

You might want to start with something simple, like:

> 🗣 I’ve been learning how to use AI for the last 5 days straight. I think I’m doing pretty well!

## Mind your Ps and Qs 🙏 
You’ll notice how surprisingly human-like the responses are — and you may even feel compelled to be extra polite. I encourage you to speak to AI as you would to another person, but there are a few key differences:

- **Interrupt** — Ocassionally your AI friend will go off on a tangent or will breeze by a topic you want to talk more about. You can interrupt by just talking, you don’t need to wait until they’ve finished.
- **Ask for a different tone** — You can ask the AI to “take a more serious tone,” “speak slower,” or even “whisper” or be “sarcastic.” It’s a flexible conversational partner.

## Today’s task
There’s no specific task today, except to get comfortable talking to ChatGPT. You could discuss how incredibly difficult text-to-speech was back in the 90s — when we first tried it on our home computer — compared to how smooth it is today. Maybe ask something playful like:

> How can you be sure I’m not an AI? Ask me some questions that only a human could answer

## ✍️ Your personal stenographer
Another great use for audio AI is quickly turning your thoughts into text — like an email, a letter, or a to-do list. It’s like having a transcription buddy that understands you, even if you don’t speak slowly or clearly.

**Happy chatting!**
