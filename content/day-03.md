# Adding Context
Each time you talk to AI about a new topic, it’s best to start a fresh chat. This helps AI stay focused and prevents it from mixing topics together. To start a new chat, tap the pencil icon in the top right corner of the screen.

Even if you’re already in the habit of doing this, a good rule of thumb is to open a fresh conversation each time you launch the app. This keeps your chats organized and ensures better responses.

## Always Learning
Even though each conversation starts fresh, AI continuously learns from the information you provide, using it to personalize responses unique to you. This might sound a little unsettling at first, but it’s also what makes AI such a powerful personal assistant.

Even if you never share personal details, AI will naturally adapt to your style over time. For example, if you consistently ask for more detail, the AI will start providing more in-depth responses by default.

Today, we’ll be giving AI a few pieces of personal information to help it craft more relevant responses. You’ll only share what you’re comfortable with — think of it like introducing yourself to someone new over coffee. 

```
Never share personally identifiable information (PII) online, including with AI. That means things like your Social Security number, passwords, or financial details are off-limits.
```

For instance, in my case, AI knows my kids’ names and ages, and that I’m gluten intolerant. This allows it to tailor responses, like suggesting gluten-free recipes or activities suited to my children’s ages.

# An Introduction 👋 
Let’s begin by introducing ourselves to AI. Open a new chat and type:

> I'd like to introduce myself, so you know a bit more about me

You’ll notice that AI won’t always jump straight into an answer — it may ask follow-up questions instead.

Today’s focus will be on health, so consider sharing details that might be relevant in that area. This could include dietary preferences, fitness goals, or any key lifestyle habits. The more relevant context you provide, the better AI can assist you.

As you add information, you might notice a **📝 Memory updated** message appear (below). This is a good sign — it means AI is remembering useful details to personalize its responses. If you ever want to review or delete these memories, just head to your Settings.

## Put AI To Work
Now that AI knows you a little better, it’s time to put it to work by helping you achieve a simple short-term goal. **Try one of these prompts** to get started (or write your own if you have a specific goal):

> Help me plan three healthy dinners for the week.

> Suggest a 10-minute daily exercise routine for beginners.

> Give me a 5-minute memory-boosting exercise I can do every day.

You should notice that the response you get is suited to the information you provided earlier. This will be the case in any future conversation you have with AI.

If the suggestions don’t quite work for you, you can always ask for adjustments! Remembering yesterday’s lesson, AI works best when you set clear expectations — so it’s completely fine to follow up with:

- 🥚 “I don’t have eggs.”
- 🤓 “That routine looks looks too easy, step it up!”
- 😮‍💨 “Those seem too difficult.”

# Assigning Roles
A powerful way to get better responses from AI is by asking it to take on a specific role. This helps AI tailor its advice based on a particular perspective or expertise, making the answers more useful to you.

So instead of asking AI a general question, try giving it a role to frame its response. For example:

**Need fitness advice?** 
> You’re a personal trainer. Design a 20-minute full-body workout for a beginner.

**Want to plan a trip?**
> You are a travel guide. Plan a 3-day trip to Paris on a budget.

Next time you chat with AI, consider what kind of expert you need — it could be a fitness coach, a nutritionist, a historian etc. This is also why starting a new chat for each topic is helpful. It ensures you’re not accidentally stuck in “fitness expert mode” when you’re really looking for travel advice!

Roles are only limited by your imagination, so you can have some fun:

- 🚀 "You're a time traveler from the year 3025. Describe what people were like 100 years ago."
- 🫠 "You're a conspiracy theorist. Tell me something about coffee the mainstream media don't want us to know!"
- 🤖 "You're a corporate buzzword generator. Describe me."
