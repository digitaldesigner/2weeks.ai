# Adding context

Over time, ChatGPT learns about you and can offer responses that are more personalized. Generally it will pick up stuff like your tone of voice and nature of your topics, but you can also feed it some personal information — which can be very helpful.

In my case, it knows the boys' names 👦🏼👦🏼 and that I'm gluten intolerant 🍝 which allows it to provide more relevant suggestions, such as offering gluten-free recipe ideas or tailoring responses to include the kid's interests. 

So today we're going to add some basic information about you so that GPTs responses are a bit more useful. Then we're going to explore how ChatGPT handles **tasks** not just questions.

## Saying g’day 👋🏼

> I'd like to introduce myself, so you know a bit more about me

You'll see that ChatGPT isn't always going to try and give you an answer, hopefully in response to the above it'll give you an opportunity to elaborate. Today's task (a little later on) will be about your physical health, so we might want to begin by providing some basic details that might be useful in that area. 

**Now write...**

> I recently turned 72 but I am in excellent physical health

You should see this next to the reply:

The `Memory updated` pill shows up whenever ChatGPT stores unique information about you — which is what we want. If you're worried about privacy, this can be managed and deleted later if you need. In contrast to some of the other popular AI tools like Gemini (Google) or Meta AI, ChatGPT is very secure and privacy focussed.

Let's continue to add anything else you think is relevant. Maybe this:

> I am recovering from a knee replacement last year, so I need to go easy on my knees


## Roles
AI can take on roles to generate more realistic answers.

Bad Prompt: Give me fitness advice.
Better Prompt: You are a professional fitness coach. Create a simple workout plan for a 50-year-old beginner with knee pain.
	•	This works for career advice, creative writing, problem-solving, and more.

🔹 Tip: Try “You are a travel guide. Plan a 3-day trip to Paris on a budget.”

## 🏋🏼‍♀️ Get to the gym!
Today's task will be to switch things up in your usual gym routine. **We'll get AI to create a workout schedule** then we'll tweak it, remembering that it'll already use some of your personal details from above. 

```
When asking GPT to create something for you — like a plan or a document — it's useful to be as descriptive as possible about the type of thing you expect. This is the golden rule with AI: if you expect a certain result it's better to be clear than polite.
```

So let's try this: 

> Write a gym routine for this week. I plan to go 4 times for 1 hour per session. I'd like to focus on general cardio and leg strength

#### Make it your own
By now GPT should have written you a fairly comprehensive schedule. But the beauty of AI — as we learned [yesterday](#day-2) — is that you can continue the conversation. So even though it's probably given you a great starting point, you could try these responses:

- That looks too easy, step it up
- What is a "Bird-dogs" exercise?
- I'd like day 3 to involve more core exercises
- I don't have access to a rowing machine (or, involve more free weights)
- ...you get the idea!

At some point in the future you might want to come back to this chat by pressing the top left menu and finding the routine.

 From here you can give additional feedback to continue the conversation, like this:

> 30 second planks were too easy, can you increase their duration

🎉 **Congrats!** Now you have your own personal trainer.
