# Writing Prompts
The biggest challenge in using AI effectively is knowing **when** to engage with it — because it’s different from what you’re used to with Google or an encyclopedia.

Google is great when you need a quick **fact**, like the name of an actor or the currency used in Iceland. But AI shines when you have a **question** that needs exploration, a vague idea you want to develop, or a topic you’re curious about.

Think of AI as a thought partner — not just a search engine, but a tool to help you brainstorm, learn, and even debate ideas.

## Prompts
The text you type into AI — the questions or instructions you ask — is known as a "prompt". These can be as vague or complex as you like, but they generally resemble questions or instructions.

You don't need to worry about spelling or grammar, you don't even need to be polite (you should, of course). A prompt is simply your starting point for a conversation. The best place to start with the concept is to ask a very broad question, **try something like...**

> How might history have changed if the internet existed in the 1800s?

## Continued Conversation
The real power of AI isn’t just in the first response — it’s in the back-and-forth conversation that follows. Think of it less like asking a search engine a question and more like chatting with a knowledgeable friend.

For example, instead of stopping after one response, you can continue the conversation naturally, just like you would with a person:

> Are there any world events that would have been prevented?

Of course, this doesn't need to be about heavy topics! You can use the same approach for everyday tasks, like adjusting a recipe based on what ingredients you have:

AI remembers the context within a chat, so you don’t have to rephrase everything from scratch. Just respond naturally, ask follow-up questions, and let the conversation flow! You can even challenge or ask for elborations, just like you would in a human conversation, **like:**

> How can you be sure?

## Set Expectations
You’ll notice by now that AI tends to answer in very wordy, but quite broad responses. So if you’re looking for a specific kind of answer, or you’d like to dig into a subject, it helps to mention these requirements in your prompt. You can guide AI in different ways, such as:

- Asking for a detailed explanation or a short, snappy response
- Requesting a topic be explained at a specific level of detail (e.g., beginner-friendly or expert-level)
- Formatting the answer in a certain way, like a list, poem, or step-by-step guide

**Try one of these:**

> Explain the speed of light in a way a 5-year-old could understand

> Summarize the biggest world records broken in 2024 in one paragraph

> Give me three pros and cons of electric cars in a simple list

As you get more comfortable with AI, you’ll start to refine your prompts to get better responses. But for now, just remember — if the answer isn’t quite what you expected, you can always adjust your prompt or ask AI to try again!
