Knowing **when** to engage AI is biggest challenge in using the tool effectively — in this sense you have to unlearn what you know of Google (or finding facts in an encyclopedia).

Google is still the right place when you need a **fact**... the name of an actor or the currency used in Iceland. AI is best when you have a **question**, or the beginnings of a thought or interest. Imagine AI as a really smart debating partner.

**Try something like:**

> What are the arguments for a better definition of the "welfare of the child" principal in the court system?

## Follow-on
The real beauty comes in the follow-up discussion, which is something Google cannot do. For example, in the same chat you might continue talking, as if you would with a person. Remember, you don't need to worry about spelling or formatting, or contain any context from the last thing you said. Let it flow...

> are there any high profile cases where this has been controversial?

Of course this doesn't need to be about heavy topics, I quite often take the same approach with dinner:

The words you use to engage with AI is called a **"prompt"** and the way you ask questions is important. You'll develop this as you go, but the key is to be clear with any expectations.

Throughout the day try and be mindful of any time you have a question — and try to ask GPT. Let me know any interesting questions you come up with. Here are some weird questions I've had recently:

- If a rocket was landing on the moon right now, would you see it with the naked eye?
- Do large animals have large cells and smaller animals smaller cells or do all animals have the same size cells?
- I've got a Japanese whetstone here. It's got a 1000 and a 3000 grade. Which one do I start with?
- Austin is swinging in a swing and when his legs are down he goes slow and when his legs are up he goes fast. What physical properties are at play here?
- Any recipes that can use overripe bananas?
