# Introduction to ChatGPT
To get started, download the official ChatGPT app from the App Store and follow the steps to create an account. For the best experience, I recommend subscribing to the **$20**/month Plus Subscription, though it’s not required—most features are available on the free version:

Look for this icon 👆🏼 to ensure you’re downloading the right app, as there are several copycats. The official app is developed by OpenAI. Once inside the app, here’s what you’ll see:

- **1, App Menu** This is where you’ll find all your previous conversations and access your settings. We’ll explore this later.
- **2, Chat Tools** These let you manage the current chat, such as sharing or deleting it. The `4.0` refers to the AI model, but you probably won’t need to adjust this.
- **3, New Chat** If you want to start a fresh conversation, use this icon. It’s a good idea to start a new chat whenever the context changes (more on this later).
- **4, Add** You can add photos or files to provide extra context in a conversation. We’ll dive into this feature later on.
- **5, Message** This is where you type your message, just like in Messenger or iMessage. Only here, you’re chatting with an AI.
- **6, Audio** Tap this to speak your message instead of typing. We’ll cover this feature in more detail later, but feel free to give it a try!

## Task #1
Today, we’ll get you familiar with ChatGPT in a simple way. I’ve written a prompt to help you get started. When you click the Try button, it will open the app and copy the text to your clipboard. Once you’re in ChatGPT, just tap the message field and paste the prompt:

> Tell me an interesting fact about the America's Cup sailing race.

This will give you a sense of how ChatGPT responds. Feel free to continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions like you would with a real person. Let me know if you discover anything fun!
