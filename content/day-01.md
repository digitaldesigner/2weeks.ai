# A Guide to AI Apps
<div class="tag"><span class="level-1">Beginner</span></div>

To use AI, you’ll need an AI app. There are many available, but the easiest and most popular is **ChatGPT** by OpenAI. You might have also heard of Gemini by Google or Meta AI.

Think of AI tools like search engines such as Google — easy to use, with a few good options to choose from. While they have some differences, they all work in a similar way: you ask a question into a chat interface, and the AI will provide helpful answers.

## Download ChatGPT
For this course, we'll use **ChatGPT** (although you're welcome to bring your own tool). If you're on an iPhone, you can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) or from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt) on Android.

To get started simply download the official ChatGPT app from OpenAI (watch out for imitations). When it's ready, for the best experience I'd recommend following the in-app instructions to create an account.

# Tour of ChatGPT
AI apps are incredibly simple, usually just consisting of a text box where you can type your questions — ChatGPT is no different, and looks a lot like a messaging app. At the top of the screen you’ll see some simple icons:

- `1` **App Menu** – Access all your past conversations and settings here. Tap it to see a list of your chats.
- `2` **Upgrade** – This shows which version of ChatGPT you’re using. If you’re on the free version, you’ll see an option to subscribe — but don’t worry, everything in this course works with the free version.
- `3` **Temporary Chat** — Toggle this to switch between private (unsaved) and normal chat mode. It’s like using an incognito tab in a browser.

Once you’ve started chatting, the header will change subtly with the following options:

- `4` **Manage Chat** – Tap this to access options for managing your chat, like sharing, renaming, or deleting it.
- `5` **New Chat** – Start a fresh conversation here. This is useful when switching topics to keep responses relevant and organized.

- `6` **Message** – This is where you type your message, just like in Messenger or iMessage — but here, you’re chatting with an AI instead of a person.
- `7` **Add** – Use this icon to add photos or files to provide extra context in a conversation. We’ll dive into this feature later on.
- `8` **Modes** – Choose between two options for different types of responses: **Search** finds relevant web links, **Reason** provides deeper, more context-aware answers. If you’re not sure which to use, you can stick with the default for now.
- `9` **Microphone** – Converts your voice into text, perfect for hands-free messaging. 
- `10` **Voice** – Speak directly to the AI instead of typing. We’ll cover in more detail later, but feel free to give it a try!

# Today's Lesson
You've done the heavy lifting in installing the app, so today we'll get you familiar with AI in a simple way.

Below is a message to help you understand what to expect of AI. Throughout this course you’ll see messages like the one below with ideas for things to ask AI — when you tap the <code class="button">Try</code> button, the text will be copied to your clipboard. All you have to do is open ChatGPT and paste! **Try this...**

> Tell me an interesting fact about the human body.

**Or...**

> Teach me how to make the perfect coffee!

Feel free to continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions like you would with a real person.
