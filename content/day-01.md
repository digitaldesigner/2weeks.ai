# A Guide to AI Apps
To use AI, you’ll need an AI app. There are many available, but the easiest and most popular is **ChatGPT** by OpenAI. You might have also heard of Gemini by Google or Meta AI.

Think of AI tools like search engines such as Google — easy to use, with a few good options to choose from. While they have some differences, they all work in a similar way: you ask a question into a chat interface, and the AI will provide helpful answers.

### Download
For this course, we'll use **ChatGPT** (although you're welcome to bring your own tool). If you're on an iPhone, you can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) or from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt) if you use an Android.

To get started simply download the official ChatGPT app from OpenAI (watch out for imitations). When it's ready, for the best experience I'd recommend following the in-app instructions to create an account.

### App Tour
AI apps are incredibly simple, usually just consisting of a text box where you can type your questions &mdash; ChatGPT is no different, and looks a lot like a messaging app:

- `1` **App Menu** – This is where you’ll find all your previous conversations and access your settings. We’ll explore this later.
- `2` **Chat Tools** – Tapping here gives you options to manage the current chat, such as sharing or deleting it.
- `3` **New or Temporary Chat** – In a new chat, this icon will enable you to switch between private (chats won't be saved) and normal mode. If you're already in a chat, this icon will let you start a new one. It’s a good idea to start a new chat whenever the topic moves on to something new.
- `4` **Add** – Use this icon to add photos or files to provide extra context in a conversation. We’ll dive into this feature later on.
- `5` **Message** – This is where you type your message, just like in Messenger or iMessage. Only here, you’re chatting with an AI.
- `6` **Mode** – Search mode is sometimes available and allows you to perform more of a direct search, like you would with Google.  
- `7` **Audio** – Tap this to speak to AI, instead of typing. We’ll cover this feature in more detail later, but feel free to give it a try!
