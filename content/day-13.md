# Beyond the Basics
<div class="tag"><span class="level-3">Advanced</span></div>

As you might imagine, we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI is capable of. Fortunately, the foundational skills you’ve gained during this course will help you adapt and experiment as you continue exploring AI tools.

Today, we’re taking a quick tour of some fascinating AI applications we haven’t explored yet — things like storytelling, translation, parenting tips, and even therapy. Each of these could be an entire course on its own, but this lesson will give you a taste of what’s possible and some avenues to explore!

# Translation
AI translation is more than just swapping words — it understands context, sentence structure, and idioms to provide more natural translations. While it’s not perfect, it’s incredibly useful for everyday communication, learning languages, or even getting you out of a sticky situation!

## 📝 Written Translation
If you need a quick translation from text you have available on your device, just paste a foreign sentence and ask AI to translate it:

> Translate “Vous êtes arrêté pour nudité publique sur un bateau de croisière” into English please!

Or even ask AI to translate your own words into multiple languages at once:

> How do you say “Where is the nearest train station?” in Spanish, French, and Japanese?

## 🎙️ Live Voice Translation
If you prefer speaking, AI can provide live translations using the voice tool. This is especially handy when traveling or chatting with someone who speaks another language. Here’s a demonstration of this in action:

Or if you’re learning a language, AI can give feedback on your spoken messages, correct mistakes, and even suggest improvements!

> Help me practice my French pronunciation. How does this sound?

## 📸 Photo Translation
By uploading images or photos you’ve taken, AI can analyze and extract text for translation. Simply add photo of the text, and AI will translate it instantly – perfect for menus, signs, or documents:

<picture>
  <source srcset="./assets/images/monkey-sign-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme:dark)">
  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/monkey-sign.png" />
</picture>

# Storytelling
As we learned with planning and decision-making, AI can be a reliable creative partner — useful for coming up with story ideas, helping you brainstorm and building characters. Whether silly, dramatic, or poetic, AI can help you get past the blank-page problem!

## 🎭 Play with Different Styles
In the same way we assigned roles, earlier — AI can adapt its storytelling style based on your request. You could ask for a story in the style of a dramatic Shakespearean monologue, a goofy children’s book, or a suspenseful thriller. How about:

> My child just threw a tantrum about losing his imaginary duck. Write this as a funny screenplay.

Or go with one of these:

- 🦆 Write a poem about an angry goose.
- ⛵ Create a funny story about a sailor named André.
- 🌸 Summarize our last two weeks as a haiku.

## 🎟️ Interactive Storytelling
AI can also function well as a collaborative storyteller — where you start a story, then AI continues it. Remember, the more details you provide, the more creative and unique the story will be!

> I’ll write the first sentence of a story, and you continue it!

# Parenting Sidekick
If you have kids, babysit, or spend time with a little one full of endless questions — AI can be your (secret) sidekick. Start by creating a new chat:

> I’m spending the day with Bodkin, he’s 4. I’m going to need some help answering his questions!

Now you’re ready for those *“Why don’t bugs wear clothes?”* moments with kid-friendly written or spoken responses. 

AI can also step-in when you need extra patience and unlimited ideas:

- 🌛 **Making up bedtime stories** – “Write the outline of a short story involving a brave peanut.”
- 🧪 **Coming up with fun activities** – “Give me three simple science experiments for a toddler.”
- 🧱 **Using what you’ve got** – “Give me some fun Lego challenges that only require a handful of basic blocks.”
- 🏴‍☠️ **Learning through play** — “Pretend to be a pirate teaching my child how to count.”

AI can also be a helpful partner when navigating more complex parenting challenges with older children. If you’re unsure how to handle friendship conflicts, school stress, or screen time battles, try:

> How can I help my child manage social media in a healthy way?

You might find it can offer new perspectives, strategies, and even role-play scenarios to help you prepare for tricky situations... or *that* discussion 🕊🐝

## AI Therapist
Sometimes you just need to talk things through. AI can be a patient listener, offering empathy, perspective, and gentle suggestions when you’re feeling overwhelmed. It’s not a replacement for a professional, but it can be a helpful first step — especially since it’s available day or night, it’s free, and won’t judge you.

> I’m feeling pretty run-down at the moment.

AI will generally respond with encouragement and often tips to help you process your thoughts. Some other ways it can help:

- 💡 **Reframing negative thoughts** – “I feel stuck in my job. Can you help me see this differently?”
- ☀️ **Daily check-ins** – “Ask me three questions to check in on my mood and well-being.”
- 🧘 **Mindfulness & relaxation** – “Guide me through a simple breathing exercise.”

```
Remember, AI is a helpful tool, but it’s not a trained therapist. If you’re dealing with serious mental health concerns, professional support is always the best path forward.

# AI Images (and Video)
Image and video generation is a rapidly evolving area of AI. But rather than thinking of AI as the final product, it’s best used as a creative tool — something to spark ideas, refine concepts, and enhance your own work. Here’s how you can experiment with ChatGPT’s built-in image generation:

## 📖 Story Illustrations
At any point in a conversation, you can ask AI to *“Make a picture of…”* and describe what you’d like to see. Try this when:

- 🍽️ **Cooking a recipe** – Want to see what the final dish might look like?
- ✍️ **Bringing stories to life** – Generate illustrations of characters, settings, or entire scenes from your writing.
- 🎨 **Brainstorming creative ideas** – Need logo concepts, a futuristic cityscape, or a new interior style? AI can help visualize your ideas.

Try this:

> Illustrate "Mr Peanut" the superhero character in my children's bedtime story!

```
If ChatGPT doesn't produce the image you were hoping for, you can say "Try again" or provide more details like "the peanut needs a beard".
```

# Writing Code
You might not think you need coding skills — but if you use spreadsheets, you’re already working with logic-based formulas! This is an area where AI can be used to help write, debug, and optimize code for all sorts of tasks, whether you’re working in Excel, Google Sheets, or even dabbling in programming. For example:

> I need an Excel formula that calculates the total sales, but only if the order was placed in the last 30 days.

Or if you’re already an Excel-pro, AI can help debug errors in formulas. Simply ask *“Why isn’t this formula working?”* and AI can break it down.

## 🚀 Automating Tasks
If you’re working in Google Sheets, AI can help with more advanced features you might have previously avoided — like Macros, or writing Apps Script (Google’s coding language) to automate repetitive tasks:

> Write a Google Apps Script that sends an email when a new row is added.

This can be a game-changer for tracking expenses, automating reports, or setting up reminders.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Support
Even if you don’t use spreadsheets or have any need for coding, AI can still be a lifesaver for everyday tech problems. Whether it’s a glitchy phone, a slow internet connection, or a stubborn printer, AI can walk you through step-by-step troubleshooting with clear, common-sense advice.

> My iPhone battery drains too fast. What settings should I check?

You can also use this to help identify scams — if you get a suspicious email, a call from “Microsoft,” or an urgent pop-up warning you of a virus, just copy and paste the text (or upload an image) and ask AI for a second opinion.

> Is this Nigerian prince legit?

AI can help you analyze the message, check for common scam tactics, and offer advice on whether it’s safe to engage. Here are some common scam signs AI can help you spot:

- ✉️ Phishing emails pretending to be from banks or big companies.
- 📱 Fake tech support calls that demand remote access to your device.
- 🛍 Online shopping scams with deals that seem too good to be true.
