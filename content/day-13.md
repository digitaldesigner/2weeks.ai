# You, enhanced!
Over the last two weeks, we’ve covered a lot to help you make the most of AI. There’s always more to learn, but much of the magic will reveal itself as you keep exploring. Here’s a quick rundown of a few topics we didn’t dive into, in case you’re ready to go further:

# Translation 🤟🏼
While we touched on translating slang, AI can handle more traditional translations too. You can type in any foreign text and ask for a translation:

> Translate “Vous êtes arrêté pour nudité publique sur un bateau de croisière” into English please!

🗣 Or, use the voice function to get live translations. [Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2DFg53Zhvw) showing it in action. Plus, you can even upload a picture of a foreign sign to have it translated on the spot.

# For storytelling 🌈
AI is a great storytelling partner if you give it some fun prompts. Try this:

> Write a few silly paragraphs advertising a whimsical, imaginary product.

Or go with one of these:

- 🦆 Write a poem about an angry goose.
- ⛵ Craft a funny story about a sailor named André.
- 🌸 Summarize our last two weeks as a haiku.

# Your extra parent 🧒🏼
Got kids who ask endless questions? AI can be your backup! If you’re hanging out with a little one, try starting a new chat:

> I’m spending the day with Bodkin, he’s 4. Please answer as if you’re talking to him!

Then you’re ready for those **“Why don’t bugs wear clothes?”** moments with kid-friendly responses.

# Creating images
Image generation is an exciting side of AI we didn’t cover because it’s a bit advanced. While ChatGPT (with DALL-E) isn’t the top AI for images, it’s fun to try. Here’s how:

## Conversational image creation
At any point, ask ChatGPT to “Make a picture of…” and describe what you’d like to see in detail, like this:

> Make an image of a spider wearing a tiny hat, in the style of high-def nature photography.

You might get a fun, clipart-style result. But if you want realism, check out [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) for a market-leading experience, like this:

## Prompting with pictures
For a unique twist, try using a photo as a prompt to inspire new images. This is especially fun for bringing kids’ drawings to life or creating quick, personalized illustrations to accompany a story. Simply upload a photo and let AI work its magic!

```
If ChatGPT doesn't produce the image you were hoping for you can say "Try again" or ask for more details like "give the spider a tiny beard".
```

# Writing code 🗒
You might not think you have a need for code, but I’ll bet you use spreadsheets. AI can help you write formulas, debug or even create entirely new sheets which you can download. Try:

> Help me create a spreadsheet to track my investments, where I can enter contributions and the monthly balance, and it calculates growth automatically.

Hopefuly these ideas showcase just how versatile AI can be beyond simple Q&A. And by now you will have learned how to write good prompts, so using the above techniques effectively will be well within your reach!

🎨 Bonne création d’images!

Remember: The trick to useful AI responses is to have a clear outcome in mind and be specific in your description.
