# Getting Opinionated
<div class="tag"><span class="level-1">Beginner</span></div>

Over the past few lessons, we’ve explored how to craft effective prompts, assign roles to AI, ask follow-up questions, and personalize responses for better results.

So far, we’ve used AI when we already had a clear idea of the outcome — like getting an answer to a question or generating a workout plan. But AI isn’t just a tool for confirming what we already know. Today, we’re flipping that around and using AI to **question what we think we know** and explore ideas in ways we might not have considered.

## Asking Better Questions
We often think of AI as something to turn to when we need an answer. But it’s even more valuable when we use it **before** we even know what to ask. Maybe you have an idea, a topic you’re curious about, or a vague sense that something doesn’t quite add up — but you don’t know where to start.

AI can help shape those thoughts, introduce fresh perspectives, and challenge assumptions we might not even realize we’re making. Here are some examples of **“unformed”** questions that AI can help turn into meaningful discussions:

- 📸 “Older generations had very few photographs documenting their lives, while my kids will have thousands. Is that a good thing?”
- 🍝 “I always assumed that eating late at night is bad for you, but is that actually true?”
- 🏠 “Everyone says owning is better than renting, but is that always the case?”

Engaging AI with half-formed thoughts is a powerful way to refine your understanding and shape your own opinions. This is where follow-up questions become especially valuable — giving you the freedom to ask “dumb” questions without fear of judgment.

More often than not, AI will respond with thought-provoking questions of its own or guide the conversation in unexpected yet enlightening directions. Sometimes, the best insights come not from having the right answers, but from asking the right questions. 💡

# Challenge Your Perspective
One of the best ways to sharpen your reasoning — or solidify your convictions — is to challenge your own opinions. AI can be a powerful tool for this, acting as an unbiased debate partner that forces you to consider different perspectives.

There are many ways to do this, but here are a couple of fun and effective approaches:

## 🔥 Play Devil’s Advocate

Think of a belief or opinion you hold strongly. Now, ask AI to argue against it. **Try:**

> “I believe social media is making us more disconnected. Play devil’s advocate and argue the opposite.”

In a real conversation, willingly jumping into a debate with a friend might cause tension. But AI won’t get offended — it’s the perfect opponent for testing your ideas in a risk-free way.

## 🔄 Generate New Angles
AI can help you break out of predictable thinking by introducing fresh, unexpected perspectives on any topic. If you’re stuck looking at something the same way, AI can challenge assumptions and reveal entirely new angles you might not have considered.

This is especially useful in a professional setting, where it can introduce fresh viewpoints — including historical and scientific angles — and spark new ideas and creative solutions.

> What are some unique ways to think about time? Could it be measured differently? Give me some unusual, creative, or even absurd perspectives.

Or use AI to challenge your cultural understanding of a topic. For example:

> I think of the past as being behind me and the future ahead. Are there cultures or philosophies that view time differently?

By questioning our own assumptions, AI can help us uncover hidden biases in how we perceive the world and introduce us to alternative ways of thinking — all without losing friends!

A little intense? Try asking, “If Napoleon had access to email, what would his inbox look like?”
