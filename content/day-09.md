# Climbing trees 🌳 travelling India and choosing a dinner spot
Earlier, we talked about how AI can be especially helpful when you have the **beginnings** of a thought, an interest, or an idea — like mapping out a new trip or brainstorming a DIY project. AI can help turn those early sparks into a structured plan by suggesting next steps and refining your ideas. Today, we’re diving deeper into that concept, learning how to use AI to create clearer, more organized plans.

```
This technique is great for big projects like home renovations or major DIY tasks—but it’s just as handy for small decisions, like choosing where to go for dinner or how to spend a day off.
```

This approach is known as a **Decision Tree**. It’s a simple way to break a complex decision into smaller, manageable choices. When you use the term "decision tree" in your prompt, it encourages ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions, create pros and cons lists, and help you explore different branches of a decision step-by-step. 

## 🗺 Remember, it’s a journey...
By now, you’re familiar with how valuable it is to keep the conversation going. The strength of decision trees lies in your ability to continue the discussion and use the chat history as context. Instead of looking for a single answer, you’re **collaborating** with AI to explore the best solution together.

## Plan a trip to India 🇮🇳
Here’s an example of what a prompt might look like:

> I want to plan a big trip to India, but I'm not sure where to go. Can you help me create a decision tree based on budget, distance, climate, and available activities?

AI will then provide you with options based on your criteria. For instance, under **Budget**, you’ll get options for low, medium, and high budget trips. From there, you can refine the choices:

> Mid-budget sounds good, but I'd like to stay coastal

After a few interactions like this, you might find it helpful to dive deeper into a specific decision:

> Create a decision tree for 3 weeks in Goa, focusing on how to get around

## Remix it!
Some of the most interesting discussions happen when you change direction completely within the same conversation. For example, after planning your ideal holiday to India, you could throw in a curveball that you’d never want to bother a travel agent with:

> Okay what if I stayed home instead? Options for using a similar budget?

## Possibilities
AI can be incredibly useful for narrowing down broad questions, saving time by breaking complex decisions into manageable parts. Here are just a few ideas of when you might want to use it:

- ⚖️ **Career decisions** such as evaluating potential career paths based on salary, experience, commitment etc 
- 💵 **Financial investments** like deciding between different investment options based on risk
- 💊 **Health and fitness goals** such as evaluating medical treatment options by comparing side effects, costs, and effectiveness
- 🚗 **Purchasing decisions** like evaluating different car models based on cost, fuel efficiency, and features

Or, maybe you’ve just worked up an appetite from reading this:

> I'm on a cruise ship. There are 29 restaurants and I’m hungry for dinner. Create a decision tree to help me decide where to eat.
