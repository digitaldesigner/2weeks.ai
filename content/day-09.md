# Decision Making
In our last lesson, we explored **Planning** — where we used AI to go beyond simple Q&A by exploring ideas, breaking down goals, and creating a roadmap to achieve them. Today, we’re building on that by diving into **Decision Making** — where AI can be used to help weigh options, analyze trade-offs, and choose the best path forward.

If planning is about asking, *“How do I get from A to B?”*, then decision making is about asking, *“Should I take Path A or Path B?”*. The ideas is to use AI to make faster, smarter, and more objective decisions — removing guesswork and bias along the way.

## Can You Trust AI?
Before we dive into today’s lesson, there’s an uncomfortable but important reality to acknowledge: AI gets **confused** —sometimes in subtle ways, and other times in completely ridiculous ways. Even the best AI tools can stumble over basic tasks:

AI responses can **sound** authoritative, but that doesn’t mean they’re always correct. Like people, AI can misunderstand context, make logical errors, or even confidently provide incorrect information.

Later in the course, we’ll cover fact-checking and verifying sources, but for today keep in mind that any advice AI provides should always be questioned — especially when making important decisions!

# 🌳 Decision Trees
While planning is about creating a roadmap for an idea, decision making is about choosing the best path at each fork in the road. AI can assist with both but relies on different methods — when faced with a decision-based prompt, it will structure its response using a **decision tree** framework.

A decision tree is simply a way to break down a choice into a series of clear, logical steps. AI is particularly good at using this method because it’s unbiased — it can present your options objectively, helping you weigh the pros and cons without emotional influence. **Try:**

> Should I buy a new car or keep my old one? Create a decision tree.

Of course, you don’t need to explicitly ask for a decision tree every time — you can simply give AI two or more options and ask for help deciding. The response should present a clear breakdown of your choices, guiding you toward the best course of action. And in cases where the right decision is obvious, AI may even offer a strong recommendation.

Here are some different ways you can use decision trees and AI’s decision making abilities to help in your everyday life:

## ⚖️ Weighing Trade-Offs
We can ask AI to break down decisions into clear trade-offs by listing the pros and cons of each option. This makes it easier to see the strengths and weaknesses of your choices. **Try:**

> Can you list the pros and cons of working from home vs. going back to the office?

## 🤔 Simulating Outcomes
AI can predict different outcomes based on the context you provide, helping you evaluate long-term strategies. This is especially useful for financial or major life decisions. **Try:**

> Help me decide whether I should rent or buy a home. Consider my budget, location and long-term financial goals.

You can also refine the decision by introducing new variables after the initial output:

> What if interest rates rise? How would that change my decision?

## 🎭 Unbiased Suggestions
Because AI isn’t influenced by emotions or social pressure, it can provide neutral, logical recommendations — helpful when making difficult or emotionally charged choices. **Try:**

> I’m choosing between two schools for my child. One has smaller class sizes but requires changing schools, while the other is their current school with larger class sizes. Can you help me decide?

## 🔄 Flip It
Finally, AI isn’t just useful for making future decisions — it can also help you re-evaluate past choices to see if they were solid or if you might have overlooked something important.

> I recently decided to stop showering. Can you help me identify any important factors I might have overlooked?

Remember to treat AI answers the same way you would advice from a friend — helpful, but not always 100% reliable. If in doubt, ask: "How confident are you that this information is correct?"
