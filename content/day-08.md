# Making Plans
Planning can be tough. Whether it’s **big plans** like vacations or events, **long-term goals** like fitness or learning, or **immediate tasks** like work deadlines, grocery trips, or simply structuring your day — keeping everything in order can feel overwhelming. AI can be useful in cutting through the chaos, helping you stay organized, and making smarter decisions.

In every lesson so far, we’ve started a new chat to keep the context fresh and avoid confusing AI. But today’s lesson is a great example of when continuing an existing conversation can actually be helpful. By keeping your planning discussions in the same chat, AI can remember details, refine ideas, and build on past suggestions — just like a real assistant.

Today we’ll start with a new chat, but if you revisit this lesson later, you can find and continue the conversation by pressing the sidebar icon:

  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/side-drawer-location.png" />

From here you an jump to a previous chat and continue the conversation:

# Think Big!
Today, we’ll see how AI can help plan a weekend getaway — and in the process, you’ll discover how it breaks big tasks into smaller, manageable steps, suggests timelines, and offers alternative options. We’ll start with a **fictional** plan, but if you have something specific — like an upcoming holiday, event, or hectic week — you can choose your own adventure.

Let’s plan a weekend getaway to your home town or city. This way, you’ll see firsthand whether the recommendations are any good:

> Help me plan a 3-day long weekend in {{your town}}.

## Refine
Just like we’ve added context and follow-on conversations in previous lessons, plans can be easily adjusted with new details — or even pushed in an entirely different direction.

Once you have the outline of your plan, you might want to refine it with specifics:

> I’d like to make it a luxury trip, spare no expense!

You can tweak the details as much as you like — change the budget, add constraints, ask questions, or even suggest ideas of your own — without needing to track every change manually. Since AI remembers the conversation, you can focus on the fun parts, like exploring alternatives:

> Can you give me a couple of other options?

And if you change your mind? No problem! You can always say: **“Actually, let’s stick with the first plan.”** This also works for creating backup plans in case things don’t go as expected.

## Turn Plans Into Action
Sometimes, the hardest part of planning is knowing where to start — and that’s another thing AI can help with. Whether it’s a luxury getaway, a road trip, or even a new workout routine — a great way to move forward is by prioritizing tasks:

> Give me a list of priorities to make this plan a reality!

By letting AI handle the structure, you can focus on making your plans happen!

# Or, Make Smaller Plans
AI-backed planning isn’t just helpful for the big plans — like trips or life events — it can be useful for the day-to-day jobs too. At the very least, it can help provide some creative alternatives to your own ideas. Here are some smaller plans where AI can help:

## 💰 Budgeting for a Big Purchase
If you’re saving up for something important or expect a big outgoing in the future, AI can help break down your budget and create a savings plan. **Try:**

> I want to save $5,000 for a trip in 6 months. Can you help me create a realistic savings plan?

You can adjust it by adding income, expenses, and your own ideas on ways to cut costs or increase savings.

## 🚀 Planning a Side Hustle
If you have early ideas for a small business venture or a fun side project — AI can help you organize the steps to get it off the ground. **Try:**

> Help me create a 3-month plan to start an online business selling hand-knitted socks for hedgehogs.

## 🎒 Getting the Kids to School on Time
Mornings with kids are chaotic. Fortunately AI can help you create a streamlined routine that ensures everyone gets out the door on time, and with their sanity. **Try:**

> Help me create a morning routine to get the kids to school on time, factoring in breakfast, getting dressed, and travel time.

You can refine the plan with specifics like school start times, different schedules for each child, or even backup plans for when things go off track.

## 🌮 Meal Planning
You can of course use AI to generate a weekly meal plan tailored on your dietary needs, budget, schedule and effort. **Try:**

> Create a weekly meal plan for a family of four, focusing on quick, healthy dinners.

Once you have a plan you like the look of, you could follow-up with:

> Make a grocery list of the items I’ll need for the week.

Whether you follow AI’s suggestions to the letter, or just use them as a starting point for better decision-making — the process can help you stay organized, think ahead, and tackle big tasks with ease! Not convinced? Here are a few extra ideas:
