# Preparing for a trip 🌊
Since tomorrow you’re heading out on a cruise with a fair bit of free time on your hands, let’s spend today getting ChatGPT set up to make the trip more comfortable and fun.

## Packing smart 🎒
You’re probably (hopefully) already packed, but AI can help you think of some extra items that might make those long ocean days even more calm:

> What are some interesting or often forgotten items I should pack for a 12-day cruise?

Feel free to make it more personal—mention any weather info, planned activities, or specific things you’re excited about.

## Prepare for dinner 🍽️
You probably already have a full itinerary, so there’s no need for AI to create a workout or relaxation schedule (unless you’d like). Instead, it could be fun to come up with some interesting conversation starters for dinner with other guests:

> Give me a list of interesting conversation starters I can use at dinner with other guests.

Having worked in hospitality I can tell you that most guests often stick to the same few questions, so when chatting with the crew, you might want to mix things up a bit:

> What are some original questions I could ask the crew that will give me some insight into what goes on behind the scenes?

## Creating a cruise journal 📓✍️
In a separate chat, you could keep a daily journal of your cruise experiences. Rather than just writing notes, you can have AI help by prompting you with questions. Each day, you could say:

> It’s day {X} of the cruise, ask me 3 questions to help me journal my experiences.

Returning to the same chat each day will allow you to build a complete record of your journey. At the end of the cruise, we can explore some fun ways to use that full chat.

## Entertainment backup plan 🎮
Should you get bored, AI can be a lighthearted companion when books and activities run thin. Try:

> Can you play 20 Questions with me?

Or...

> Give me a series of riddles to solve, starting easy and getting harder

### Some more ideas...

- **Creative Writing Prompts**: "Give me a prompt for a short story, and let’s build the story together step by step."
- **Guess the Song:** "Describe the lyrics or theme of a popular song, and I'll try to guess what it is."
- **Would You Rather**: "Let’s play a game of Would You Rather with some fun, unusual scenarios."
- **Two Truths and a Lie**: "I’ll tell you two truths and a lie, and you guess which one is the lie. You can also create some for me to guess!"

This will keep your brain active, make those ocean days fly by and hopefully keep you exited about AI.

Happy sailing 🫡
