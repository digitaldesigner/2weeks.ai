# Using Images
<div class="tag"><span class="level-2">Intermediate</span></div>

AI isn’t just for text and voice — it can also analyze images and provide insights, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks. While you may not use this feature every day, when you do, it’s pretty impressive!

To add or upload an image, simply tap the plus `+` icon next to the message box. The options are similar across desktop and mobile AI tools.

<picture>
  <source srcset="./assets/images/upload-action-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme:dark)">
  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/upload-action.png" />
</picture>

- 📷 **Camera** - Snap a picture with your camera
- 🖼 **Photos** - Choose an image from your phone’s gallery
- 🗂 **Files** - Upload any file (we’ll cover this in a later lesson)

Once uploaded, you can ask AI to describe, analyze, or even edit the image.

## When To Use Images With AI
AI can analyze images almost as well as you can—and in some cases, even better. If an image contains text, AI can read it. If it includes people or a specific context, AI will try to understand the situation. You can then use this information as a foundation for more insightful questions.

Here are some real-world ways to use image uploads in your day-to-day life:

### Decipher Confusing Instructions
Ever stared at a parking sign for way too long, trying to figure out if you’re about to get fined? AI can help! By uploading an image and adding relevant context—like the current day and time, and how long you plan to park — AI can quickly break it down for you:

  <source srcset="./assets/images/parking-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme:dark)">
  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/parking.png" />
</picture>

This technique works in many situations where instructions aren’t clear:

- 🧃 **Ingredient Checks** – Upload a food package label and ask AI if it aligns with your dietary preferences or goals.
- 🛠 **Assembly Instructions** — If a DIY manual is confusing, AI can simplify the steps or explain unclear symbols.
- 🖌️ **Paint Coverage** – Snap a picture of a paint can label and ask AI how much wall space it can cover.

### To Re-Build & Fix Things
AI can analyze a broken or disassembled object and suggest ways to fix, reassemble, or repurpose it. This is especially useful when showing is easier than explaining. Here are a few ways to use this feature:

- 🥗 **Recreate a Dish** — Snap a tasty meal and ask, “How can I make this at home?”.
- 🧱 **Lego Ideas** — Photograph a pile of bricks and ask, “What creative things can I build with these?”.
- 🛠 **Fixing Gadgets** — Show a broken device or tool and ask for repair suggestions.

### To Solve Mysteries
Sometimes AI can do things that are difficult — or even impossible — for the human eye alone. By analyzing images, AI can reveal details, extract hidden information, or process visuals in ways we can’t.

Here are some powerful ways AI can help:

- 📜 **Decipher Ancient or Unreadable Text** — Upload a faded document or ancient script, and AI can attempt to translate or restore the writing.
- 🌸 **Identify Plants & Flowers** — Not sure what you’re looking at? Snap a picture of a plant, and AI can tell you what it is and even provide care tips.
- 🔢 **Count Large Groups of Objects** — Need a fast way to tally items in a crowded image? AI can scan and count them for you.
- 🔎 **Enhance & Un-blur Photos** — AI can often restore or sharpen blurry images, bringing out details you couldn’t see before.
- 🌍 **Instant Translation** — Upload a street sign or restaurant menu and get AI to translate it instantly.

### To Describe
AI can accurately describe images, but how does that help in everyday life? Here are some creative and practical ways to use this feature:

- 📊 **Break Down a Chart or Graph** — Upload a confusing graph and ask, “What does this data mean in simple terms?”
- 🖼 **Generate the Perfect Caption** — Upload a photo and let AI craft a funny, poetic, or clever Instagram caption.
- 📸 **Improve Your Photography** — Share one of your recent photos and ask AI for tips on composition, lighting, and technique.

## Or... Have Some Fun!
If you haven’t experimented with AI’s image capabilities yet, now’s the time to get creative in a low-effort way. Try uploading a recent photo of yourself and asking:

> Describe this picture in the funniest way possible.

<picture>
  <source srcset="./assets/images/funny-description-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme:dark)">
  <img class="lazyload" data-src="./assets/images/funny-description.png" />
</picture>

Other variations on this are to **roast your friends** — where you upload a group photo and ask AI for the most ridiculous captions. You could assign 1920s gangster names to old family pictures, or ask AI to write a diary entry from your pet’s perspective based on their expression.

Happy snapping!
