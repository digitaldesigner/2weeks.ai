# Uploading images
A lesser-known but amazing feature of ChatGPT is its ability to recognize images. Like audio, it’s not something you’ll use every day, but when you do, it’s pretty impressive!

You can access this feature by tapping the `+` icon next to the message box:

This menu gives you three options:

- 📷 **Camera** - Snap a picture with your camera
- 🖼 **Photos** - Choose an image from your phone’s gallery
- 🗂 **Files** - Upload any file (we’ll cover this in a later lesson)

## Yes, but why? 🤔
**Great question!** You might not use this feature often, but when you do, it’s a lifesaver. Here are a few ways I’ve used it:

### To double check...

Remembering to add context (previously discussed) such as the current day and time — AI can help you quickly decipher something you might want a second opinion on. Like avoiding a fine.

### To rebuild 🥠

This saved a tantrum in our house, but this technique can also be used to get tips on how to fix an object without first trying to explain what that object is.

### To DIY 🧰
For example you could take a photo of your bike’s disc brake and ask AI how to stop the pads from rubbing. Or photograph a loose valve and ask AI what tools you’ll need to replace it. I’ve also used it while in the hardware store to quick-calculate things, like photographing a roll of tape and asking “will this cover a 2x2m plank of wood?”

### Or...
I find this genuinely funny, perhaps more than I should. But you can use AI to “roast” photos of you and your friends — all in good humour of course!

We’ve also done this to create 1920’s gangster names for people in old family photos. Surprisingly hilarious.

Of course, AI can do things that humans struggle with, or cannot do. I once photographed a flock of birds and asked AI to estimate how many there were. Not easy for our human eyes, but AI nailed it.

## (Un)Blurred lines
In this app, you’ll notice a blurred card on the home screen. Save it to your Photos, then upload it to ChatGPT and ask:

> Describe this photo. Can you transcribe the text?

Long-tap on the picture below, select `Save to Photos` and then use the 🖼 icon in ChatGPT to upload it:

Let me know what you find! 🤓
